### Entry 7: Early November
**Objective:** Optimize microcontroller data processing and refine the enclosure design.

**Progress:**
- Enhanced data processing efficiency through algorithm optimization, reducing latency in the ESP32 units.
- Modified the enclosure design for improved durability, including the use of more robust materials and better internal component arrangement.
- Encountered issues with heat dissipation within the enclosure.
