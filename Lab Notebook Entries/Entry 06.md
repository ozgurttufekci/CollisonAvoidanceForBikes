### Entry 6: Late October
**Objective:** Integrate microcontrollers with sensors and test the first enclosure prototype.

**Progress:**
- Integrated LIDAR sensor data with ESP32 units, developing a protocol for efficient data processing.
- The first 3D printed prototype of the enclosure revealed issues with internal space utilization and external mounting stability.
- Faced challenges in processing speed and data consistency with the integration of LIDAR data.
